# Openbook The App

## Abstract

This project involves the creation of a **Library Management System** designed to provide global access to libraries. The app will enable users to search for books and texts and download them as PDFs. The project explores the conditions necessary for creating an effective library management system, including technical, legal, and functional aspects.

## Introduction

**Openbook** is built on the concept of offering global access to libraries, allowing users to freely browse and download content for a limited time, attracting more people to the content. The project aims to evaluate the feasibility of such a system, considering the following key elements:

- Cost of building the app.
- Development timeline.
- Skills and expertise required.
- Size of the development team.
- Types of books and texts included.
- Legal regulations in different countries.
- Market demand for the app.

### Functional Requirements

The following are the core functionalities the system must perform:

- Allow moderators to add and remove new members.
- Provide users with a search feature to find books by title, author, publication date, and location.
- Users can request, reserve, or renew a book.
- Moderators or original book creators can manage the content.
- The system notifies users and moderators about overdue books.
- Automatically calculates fines for overdue books.
- Generates PDF files of books and provides a link for download.
- Allows moderators and original book creators to adjust the free availability time of books.
- Provide an interface for reading PDFs within the app.

### Non-Functional Requirements

The non-functional requirements define how the system should perform:

- **Usability**: Ensure ease of use for all users.
- **Accuracy**: Provide reliable search results and notifications.
- **Maintainability**: Allow easy maintenance and updates of the system.

## Project Phases

### Requirement Analysis

Both functional and non-functional requirements were identified during this phase, ensuring the app meets user needs while functioning smoothly.

### Feasibility Study

The feasibility study addresses key factors, including costs, time, skills, and legal issues. It ensures the project is achievable within realistic parameters.

### Test Plan

A test plan will be created to assess the systemâ€™s usability, accuracy, and maintainability. This plan will be crucial for validating and verifying the system using the **V&V Model** after the implementation phase.

## Main Scenario

The **Openbook** app will be available for both **iOS** and **Android** users. Here's how it works:

1. Users download the app and register with their reading preferences.
2. They are directed to a home page showing reading options tailored to their interests.
3. Users can either search for a specific book or select from recommended options.
4. The user can then proceed to a book page, where they can download the book as a PDF or read it within the app.

## Sub-Scenarios

The following sub-scenarios handle different aspects of the system:

- **Authentication Management**: Manages user login and registration.
- **User Management**: Handles user profiles and preferences.
- **Title Management**: Manages the addition and categorization of books.
- **Search Management**: Handles search queries and book retrieval.
- **Download Management**: Manages the downloading of books in PDF format.

## Authentication Management

The **Authentication Management** system secures user accounts and controls access to the app. It includes user registration, login, and password management.
